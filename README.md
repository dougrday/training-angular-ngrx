This is a multipart training workshop, aimed at teaching you basic Angular design principles with ngrx.

We'll be using the following technologies in this workshop:

* Angular
* Angular CLI
* ngrx/store
* ngrx/effects

### Previous Workshop

This workshop begins where the last workshop left off.  If you haven't already,
I recommend you complete the previous workshop before continuing:
[https://github.com/landmarkhw/training-redux-arch](https://github.com/landmarkhw/training-redux-arch)

## Part 1

1. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/landmarkhw/training-angular-ngrx.git`
1. Checkout the "part1" branch: `git checkout part1`

### How to run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### What's next?

I've added new actions and reducer for a new `auth` section of the web site.

See `auth.actions.ts` and `auth.reducer.ts`

Our next steps are adding user authentication (e.g. login).
